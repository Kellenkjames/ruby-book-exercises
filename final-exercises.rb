# 1. Use the "each" method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value. 
puts "Exercise 1"

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].each { |num| p num}

# 2. Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5. 
puts "Exercise 2"

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].each { |num| p num if num > 5 }

# 3. Now, using the same array from #2, use the "select" method to extract all odd numbers into a new array

# 7. What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash? 
puts "Exercise 7"

=begin

Array: A data structure that holds a collection of elements i.e. strings, booleans, integers, etc.. (order doesn't matter)

Hash: A data structure that is based on key-value pair relationships (values are accessed by their keys)

=end

p "----------------------"

# 8. Create a Hash, with one key-value pair, using both Ruby syntax styles. 
puts "Exercise 8"

# Ruby v.1.9 or later
hash_one = { name: "Ricardo", age: 31, location: "Miami", occupation: "Engineer" }

# Ruby v.1.8 or earlier (older syntax)
hash_two = { "name" => "Ricardo", "age" => 31, "location" => "Miami", "occupation" => "Engineer"}

# 9. Suppose you have a hash h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
puts "Exercise 9"

h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}

p "----------------------"

# 1. Get the value of key ':b"
p h[:b]

p "----------------------"

# 2. Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`
h2 = h.merge({e:5})
p h2 

p "----------------------"

# 3. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5 
h2.delete_if { |key, value| value < 3.5 }
p h2 

p "----------------------"

# 10. Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)
puts "Exercise 10"

# Answer: hash values can be arrays, and you can have an array of hashes 

# ex (hash values as arrays)
h_arr = { DeFi: ["Avalanche, Chainlink, Uniswap"], NFT: ["ApeCoin", "Polygon", "Enjin"] }
puts h_arr

# ex (array of hashes)
arr_h = [ { name: "Bob", age: 32, city: "Atlanta", profession: "Engineer" }, 
  {name: "Kalani", age:28, city: "Utah", profession: "Reality Star"},
  {name: "Justin", age:18, city: "Nashville", profession: "Singer"}
]
puts arr_h

p "----------------------"

# 11. Given the following data structures, write a program that copies the information from the array into the empty hash that applies to the correct person (one by one)
puts "Exercise 11"

contact_data = [["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],
["sally@email.com", "404 Not Found Dr.", "123-234-3454"]]

contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}, "Sally Johnson" => {}}

# Expected output:
#  {
#    "Joe Smith"=>{:email=>"joe@email.com", :address=>"123 Main st.", :phone=>"555-123-4567"},
#    "Sally Johnson"=>{:email=>"sally@email.com", :address=>"404 Not Found Dr.",  :phone=>"123-234-3454"}
#  }

contacts_manual = {
  "Joe Smith" => { :email => contact_data[0][0], :address => contact_data[0][1], :phone => contact_data[0][2]}, 
  "Sally Johnson" => { :email => contact_data[1][0], :address => contact_data[1][1], :phone => contact_data[1][2]}

p "----------------------"

# 12. Using the hash you created from the previous exercise, demonstrate how you would access Joe's email and Sally's phone number. 
puts "Exercise 12"

# Joe's email 
puts "Joe's email"
puts contacts_manual.fetch("Joe Smith").select { |k, v| k == :email }

p "----------------------"

# Sally's phone number
puts "Sally's phone number"
puts contacts_manual.fetch("Sally Johnson").select { |k, v| k == :phone }

# 13. Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? to delete all of the strings that begin with an "s" in the following array.
puts "Exercise 13"

winter = ['snow', 'winter', 'ice', 'slippery', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

winter.delete_if { |word| word.to_s.start_with?("s") }
puts winter

p "----------------------"

# Then recreate the arr and get rid of all of the strings that start with "s" or starts with "w".
winter_two = ['snow', 'winter', 'ice', 'slippery', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

winter_two.delete_if { |word| word.to_s.start_with?("s") || word.to_s.start_with?("w")}
puts winter_two

p "----------------------"

# 14. Take the following array: and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.
puts "Exercise 14"

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

a1 = a.map { |element| element.split(' ') }
a2 = a1.flatten
p a2 

# Output: ["white", "snow", "winter", "wonderland", "melting", "ice", "slippery", "sidewalk", "salted", "roads", "white", "trees"]

p "----------------------"

# 15. What will the following program output? 
puts "Exercise 15"

hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

if hash1 == hash2
  puts "These hashes are the same!"
else 
  puts "These hashes are not the same!"
end 
  
# Answer: These hashes are the same!(order does not matter when comparing hashes)

p "----------------------"

# 16. Challenge: In exercise 11, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one. Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise 11, and populate the associated data from the contact_data array. Hint: you will probably need to iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might be the Array shift and first methods.
puts "Challenge"

# Note that this exercise is only concerned with dealing with 1 entry in the contacts hash, like this:

p "----------------------"

# Step 1: Convert arr to hash (and push to empty arr)
arr = []
contact_data.each do |data|
  h = { :email => data[0], :address => data[1], :phone => data[2] }
  arr.push(h)
end 

# Step 2: Loop through contacts hash (and merge values)
contacts.each do |key, value| 
  if key == "Joe Smith"
  value.merge!(arr.first)
  elsif key == "Sally Johnson"
    value.merge!(arr.last)
  end 
end
